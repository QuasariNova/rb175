For each of the following filetypes, indicate whether that filetype is considered server-side or client-side and why.

1. Gemfile

This is server-side. This tells bundler what modules are needed to by the Ruby project and what version of ruby to use. The client will never directly read this.

---

2. Ruby files (.rb)

This is server-side. Ruby files contain the code that the server will run.

---

3. Stylesheets (.css)

This is client-side. Cascading Style Sheets are used to style web pages and the client reads them to apply those styles.

---

4. Javascript (.js)

Client-side. Javascript files are run in the browser to manipulate the view of the webpage.

---

5. View Templates (.erb)

Server-side. The server uses these to form the HTML that it will send to the client.
